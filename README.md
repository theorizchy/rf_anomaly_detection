## Overview
`rf_anomaly_detection` is a real-time hidden camera detector.
We are using a Deep Learning model, processing captured RF activity generated by Electromagnetic Emanation
produced by the hidden camera.

## Setup needed
- RaspberryPi 4B
- Raspi Camera 2.1
- Keyboard and mouse to interface with RaspberryPi Camera
- SignalHound BB60C to capture RF activity

## Follow these steps to start using `rf_anomaly_detection`

### 1. Create a python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. [OPTIONAL] Create an alias for virtual-environment activation
```
nano ~/.bashrc
alias activate='source venv/bin/activate'
source ~/.bashrc
activate
```

### 3. Install all the required dependencies
```
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```
### 4. Download SPIKE software
Go to https://signalhound.com/spike/ and download the suitable file format

### 5. Connect SignalHound (Tested with BB60C)

### 6. Launch the spike.exe

### 7. Start real-time anomaly detection
```
python reaaltime_anomaly_detector.py
```

### 8. Generated files
The generated output logs will be stored under "output_file/".
Each file will starts with "real_time_SWEEP_"
